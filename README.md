# Learning Neural Network
This is my learning playground for neural networks. Iâ€™m starting with the online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), referencing the accompanying [code](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) in the book, and making some modifications along the way.

The goal is to implement a basic neural network from scratch to gain a deep understanding of the backpropagation algorithm, the network architecture, and other key concepts involved in building effective neural networks.

And here is my blog post about this learning - [Neural Network Notes: Coding the Network from Scratch](https://wayne82.github.io/neural-network/2025/06/01/Neural-Network-Notes-Coding-the-Network-from-Scratch.html)

## Dependencies
