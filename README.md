# Learning Neural Network
This is my learning playground for neural networks. Iâ€™m starting with the online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) and referencing the accompanying [code](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning), making some modifications along the way.

The goal is to implement a basic neural network from scratch to gain a deep understanding of the backpropagation algorithm, network architecture, and other key concepts involved in building effective neural networks.

And here is my blog post about this learning - [Neural Network Notes: The Basics and Backpropagation](https://wayne82.github.io/neural-network/2025/03/30/Neural-Network-Notes-The-Basics-and-Backpropagation.html)

## Dependencies
